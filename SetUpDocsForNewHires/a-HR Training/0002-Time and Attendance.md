# Time and Attendance

All employees are expected to do their own time and attendance within the SUNY System. At the end of every month, employees are expected to submite their time and attendance sheet to their supervisor. 

The time and attendance page was made by the IT department.
If you have any questions about the web page ask the IT department.
If you have questions about the time and attendance policy ask HR.
If you have questions about how best to submit the time sheet, ask your supervisor.
