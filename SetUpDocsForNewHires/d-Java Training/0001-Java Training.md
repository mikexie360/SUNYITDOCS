# Java Training

Java Training is pretty long and probably has stuff you already know and some stuff you don't know yet.

## Some stuff you should know

Don't install java
Don't install java as an exe.
The reason why we don't install java as an exe is because the exe file will do a bunch of stuff that we don't want to do, such as auto updating java, and having a harder time to pick the jdk version.

To install java, we just want the jdk zip folder.
And we won't actually use the jdk on the computer, we will use the jdk on the virtual machine later.

We also want to be careful of what eclipse version we install.

Make sure the eclipse is eclipse EE and the correct version
The current version we are using is ????????

When we write our code and test, it will always be in eclipse, running on the machine.
For some reason we don't run java directly on the machine, only on eclipse or the VM.

Eclipse EE comes with it's own JDK, and hopefully the one that we provide to you will be the correct version.

We can't know for certain if we provide you the correct version, as every team might use a different version of JDK, Eclipse, WebLogic, Oracle. So you may have to ask for help a lot.

## What Training to do

To find the training materials, you can go to the hr portal, and try and find the training materials there.

The Java Training might take 1 or 2 weeks.

The training you have to do.

## Some extra stuff you should know about the training
You might not use everything in this training,
You also might need to do more research about specific topis that is out of scope of the training.

For example, even though the training covers Reflections, you might never use reflections.

The training does not cover spring boot, how to download third party dependencies, OAuth, how to create full stack CRUD apps, and much more.

You have to learn stuff as you go, but this training should do a decent job at catching you up what Java can do.
